* ProblemSet4.1.c
* ProblemSet4.2.c
* ProblemSet4.3.c

### Purpose ###
The purpose of this problem set is to learn to use getchar and putchar, input redirection, scanf, do file I/O, create functions, and understand variable scope.

### Description ###
ProblemSet4.1 is an exercise to open an existing text file, edit it to reverse upper and lower cases, and write the edited text into a new file. ProblemSet4.2 creates a function which sums up all increments up to the input number of the variable. ProblemSet4.3 is an exercise to understand variable scope, where when calling the main function 10 times, both the static integer and global integer variables behave according to the function created, but only the local variable's increment is not accessible.

### Build and Run Commands ###
To build each problem set, use:

```
clang ProblemSet4.1.c
clang ProblemSer4.2.c
clang ProblemSer4.3.c
```

To run each compiled program, use:

```
